# Personal Portfolio

This repository contains my personal developer portfolio where I showcase selected projects, technical skills, and ongoing work in software development.

The goal of this portfolio is not just presentation, but clarity in thought, clean implementation, and steady technical growth. It reflects how I approach building systems: structured, performance-aware, and continuously improving.

## Features

* **Fully Responsive Design** – Consistent layout across devices
* **Minimal Dark Interface** – Focused, distraction-free presentation
* **Project-Based Showcase** – Demonstrates practical implementation rather than theoretical summaries
* **Iterative Development** – Updated as I refine code quality and expand technical depth

---

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
* **Core Concepts:** Responsive design, component structuring, DOM logic, performance optimization
* **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Figma, VS Code, Lucide Icons Library

## Purpose

I built this portfolio to document my progress in computer science and software engineering.
Each project reflects increasing attention to architecture, maintainability, and problem-solving rather than surface-level features.

This repository evolves as I continue exploring full-stack systems and deeper CS fundamentals.
